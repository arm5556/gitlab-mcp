- **Only Unresolved Discussions** - focus on what matters
- **Enhanced Vulnerability Data** - precise remediation guidance

### **🏗️ Clean & Maintainable**
- **85% Less Code** (500 vs 3,490 lines) - easier to understand and extend
- **Modular Architecture** - each file has one purpose
- **TypeScript Native** - full type safety throughout

## 🔥 **The Context Problem (Solved)**

**The Challenge:** Original GitLab MCP sends ALL discussions at once
```
❌ 100+ discussions = 50,000+ tokens = Overwhelmed LLM = Missing comments
```

**Our Solution:** Smart pagination with clear metadata
```json
✅ {
  "total_unresolved": 45,    ← AI knows there's more
  "current_page": 1,         ← Clear position  
  "total_pages": 3,          ← Pagination guidance
  "discussions": [...]       ← Manageable 20 per page
}
```

**Result:** AI naturally requests all pages → **100% comment coverage** 🎯

## 🛠️ **Power Tools for AI Workflows**

**Merge Request Management:**
- `get_merge_request` - Smart MR details (by ID or branch)
- `mr_discussions` - Paginated unresolved discussions  
- `create_merge_request_note` - Reply to code review threads
- `update_merge_request` - Add labels and manage MR state

**Security & Testing:**
- `get_vulnerabilities_by_ids` - Enhanced vulnerability data with fix guidance
- `get_failed_test_cases` - Pipeline failure analysis

*Each tool returns AI-optimized responses - no raw GitLab API bloat.*

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Option 1: Local Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arm5556/gitlab-mcp.git
cd gitlab-mcp
npm install && npm run build
```

Add to your `mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitlab-ai-optimized": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./build/src/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token_here",
        "GITLAB_API_URL": "https://your-gitlab.com/api/v4"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Option 2: AI-Assisted Setup**
If you're using Claude/Cursor:
```
@mcp.json current folder is GitLab MCP fork. build and add this server
```

### **Option 3: Original Package (Comparison)**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitlab-original": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@zereight/mcp-gitlab"],
      "env": {
        "GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token_here",
        "GITLAB_READ_ONLY_MODE": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
